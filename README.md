# Automata and Formal Languages
 Automata and Formal Languages is a course about Automata and the different types of languages you can prove with them. In this repository I'll be making the homework assignments. The assignments don't count toward the final grade but serve as good practice for the exam. 

 Both the exam, and the assignments will have three major topics: Automata Engineering, Pumping Lemma, and Undecidability. That's why these assignments are such good practice, these questions will be exactly like this on the exam.
